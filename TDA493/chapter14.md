# Rethinking Data Entry
Save as, save as template, etc etc. A bit too much maybe.

Saving files needs to be really clear. Data loss is the worst.

- "Don't save"? So everything I've done will be erased? :/ But OK.
- "Cancel"? What am I canceling? Hmm. But OK.
- "Save". Alright.

Just yes/no/cancel is ambiguous. Is no/cancel the same thing?

GDrive saves continuously. What a grej. A neat way to solve it.

"Save as" is often used to make a copy. Bad naming in that case.

In some instances, files are removed altogether. They work with project instead. Bad for moving files.

Photo viewer in mobile devices: difficult to move, see size, organize in folders etc. Can be confusing.
