# Eliminating excise
**Avoid**. Something inefficient and unnecessary.

**Navigation, Visual, Modal**

- **Navigation** excise
  - When you need to move around a lot.
  - Avoid hierarchies.
  - Have common tools close at hand
  - Come up with things for fast navigation. Alt+Tab
  - *Overview and detail*
  - Don't have too many bars and stuff
  - navigation in large amount of content
    - Filter, zoom, details
    - Pan, scroll, zoom
    - Tabs, panes. **Be careful with paging**. Scroll > pages.
    - *Provide signposts*. Even if views are different, some similarity is needed.

- **Visual** excise
  - Things competing for your attention
  - Skeumorphism: *mimic real life*. Not so often used.

- **Modal** excise
  - unnecessary.
  - Error notifications
  - Confirmation screens.
  - It's for the unprobable. Most times, the person knows what they are doing.

## Avoiding
- Don't make the user remember places
- Don't make the user rescale or move windows
- Don't make the user enter unnecessary data
- Use modeless feedback and undo actions

It can be difficult if you know the function, but not the target. **Poor mapping**. On a stove, which knob is for which plate?

**Metaphors** can help understand but also limit the technical aspects.

**Allow input at output**

Recent files is very good for eliminating navigational excise. Brings back the "helpful human being" aspect of the software.
