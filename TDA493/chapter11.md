# Orchestration and flow
Have a transparent interface, allow for **flow**

## Harmonious interactions
- Follow users' mental models
- Cause and effect is important
- Less is more: very western
- commands/=controls. Print without how many pages. Default settings is nice
- hide ejector seats. Thinks that are advanced could be kept away
- reflect status
- provide modeless feedback
- *design for the probable, allow for the possible*
  - probable things should be easier to access
- imply, suggest, and hint. Input hints are good.

## Minimializing the interface
**Do more with less**

 - Take away things without taking away capabilities.

## No dialogue thanks

Choices rather than questions. Avoid dialogue boxes.

**Modeless feedback on state**  
Look busy when being busy


#Animations and motions
Don't use too often.

- Can give sense of physicality. Elasticity, gravity, etc.
- Good for
  - Focus attention, very subtle though
  - navigational transactions.
  - To show that something is happening. The circular loading icon, for example.
