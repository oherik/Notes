## Goal
*What a user want*
N책 m책l => satisfaction
**End condition**: why the user does it
### Three types of goals
- End goal: efficiency, **get something done**
- **Experience goals**: feel something, e.g. pangpangspel, experiencing something
- Life goals: be something. A bit fuzzy

The user doesn't want to feel stupid. Most important. Is an **experience goal**.

Tasks need functionality.

What is the purpose behind the goal? Goal: record teaching. Purpose: be a good teacher. Goal: why.

Activities for that goal: record, postprocessing, editing, upload, etc. Activities: what.

Tasks: do the greenscreen effect etc.

Functionalities: insert images, move images, greenscreen key effect. Functionalities: how.  


Consider: goals -> activities -> tasks -> functionalities. Move down to smaller details.

## Other stakeholders, with different goals
- Customers
  - might not be the same as user, e.g. ping pong
- Business/organization
  - Data gathering, efficiency, etc
- Tech
  - Uptime, secure user information, etc

- Modeling: create personas, model scenarios. Who will use the product, and how?
- Requirements. what funcitonalities?
- Framework: form, grouping, etc, layout
- Refinement. pixels are put on screen. Detail layout from framework
- Dev support: support the devs to continue on the same path. Read p.25.
