# Metaphors, idioms, affordances
## Affordence
***How a thing can possibly be used***. Also for physical objects.

## Pliancy
*How something can be grabbed* or tampered with. GUI-related. Indicating that the mouse pointer can be used on something.

**Static object hinting**. How a button etc looks when we don't manipulate it.  
**Dynamic visual hinting**. How it looks on hover etc  
Think button, highlight when hover  
**Pliant response hinting**. When the user clicks on the button. Feedback.  
Changes pliance when interacted with.  

**Cursor hinting**: the cursor changes appearance depending on what you're doing. Move, insert text, etc.

## Metaphor vs idiomatic (data-centric)
A button is a metaphor. Rather **limited** since the interaction often is complex.

If the same metaphor is used everywhere it becomes ambiguous.

There can be global metaphors for the whole applications, but hard to use. Avoid those!

**Intuitive metaphors**. Based on previous experience. Not necessary that everyone understand them. The print button is not really obvious.

**Idiomatic** *needs to be learned*. But good idioms are learned only once. Think right-click.


Data-centric interfaces skip metaphors. Images, titles, text, but *no metaphors*. **Modern**. E.g. dn.se

Buttons: metaphoric -> idiomatic. *Sometimes we might go too far*. It can be difficult to know what to click on. We oftenmost don't need so many metaphors, but we **shouldn't lose pliancy**.

**VR** uses more metaphors. A change "back" but is more reality-connected.
