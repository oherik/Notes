A lot of people don't need to become experts.

## Beginners

- Templates can help
- Lite the represented model follow the mental model

All this help should be able to be turned off

Beginners are **smart, but in a hurry**

## Intermediates
- Need fast actions to tools, because they are used frequently
- Hide "irreversible" commands and risky settings
- Tool tips are important
- Customization <3
- **Minimize navigation**. As efficient as possible

Intermediates want to **work fast**

## Experts
- Shortcuts to everything. Keyboard shortcuts.
- Be able to customize the interface quite much
- High information density is OK. Think Word or 3D modeling software

Remember how *to deal with large numbers of data elements*. Layers, smart search functions etc can help. Think if there's an entire city, how would the expert be able to manage all the buildings?

The want to work fast, as well. But more importantly: **they don't think, they *do***. The tools need to be very intuitive. Using tools that need to be memorized, e.g. keyboard shortcuts, is OK, because the just do things.
